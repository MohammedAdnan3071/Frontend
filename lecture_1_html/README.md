# Lecture 1 : HTML Tags and Attributes

## HTML Tags
Tags are used to create elements in an HTML page.
They usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.

<p> This is a paragraph </p>

<p> is the opening tag.
</p> is the closing tag.
The content between them is shown on the webpage.

## HTML Attributes
Attrbites give **extra information** about an element.
They are written **inside the opening tag.**

<a href="https://example.com">Visit Site</a>

<a> is a tag
href = "https://example.com" is an attribute that tells where the link goes
