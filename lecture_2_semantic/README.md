# What is HTML Semantics ?
HTML semantics means using HTML tags that clearly describe the meaning (or role) of the content inside them.
<br/>
Instead of just using <div> or <span> everywhere, you use tags like:
<br/>

1. <header> – for the top part of the page
2. <nav> – for navigation links
3. <main> – for main content
4. <section> – for sections of content
5. <article> – for blog posts or news articles
6. <footer> – for the bottom part of the page
<br/>
